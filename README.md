# Project "Contacts app"
Please note that the backend is hosted on Render.com using a free plan. This means that the server goes into a sleep mode after a period of inactivity. As a result, the initial request to the backend may take 15-30 seconds as the server "wakes up." 

The final version of the project code is located in the **`hw7-swagger`** branch. To access the final solution, please switch to this branch:

```bash
git checkout hw7-swagger
